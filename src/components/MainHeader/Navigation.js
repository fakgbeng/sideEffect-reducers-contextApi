/*
React Context
Passing data through a lot of components via props are sometimes bad practice. In react we have a component-wide, behind-the-scenes state storage called react context.

This allows us to trigger an action in that component-wide state-storage and then directly pass that to the component that is interested without building a long prop chain.

So we might ask if this is doing exactly what props is doing and even betterðŸ˜€, then why use propðŸ¤”. So we should know react context also have some limitations.

Context limitations
==> React context is not optimized for high frequency changes.
==> It also shouldn't be used to replace ALL component communications and props.
